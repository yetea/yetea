### Hey there, I'm Yetea! 🌟

#### About me

🔭 Currently, I'm working on [Open Issues](https://github.com/yetea/open-issues). 🚀

🌱 I'm always learning something new and currently geeking out on everything about TypeScript. 🤓

👯 I'm always up for a coding challenge and looking for new open source projects to collaborate on! Let's create some magic! 🎉

💬 Ask me anything about my experience with React, TypeScript, or anything related to Frontend Development. I'm happy to share my knowledge! 🤗

📫 How to reach me: yetea.dev@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me binge-watching anime, reading manga and web novels! 📚🍿
